# 🚀 GitHub Actions CI/CD Guide

## ✅ Workflow Setup Complete!

Your repository now has **automatic building** with **zero local setup** required!

---

## 📦 What's Automated

### 1. **build.yml** - Continuous Integration

**Triggers**:
- Push to `main`, `master`, or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to these branches
- Manual dispatch from Actions tab

**What it does**:
1. ✅ **Auto-generates Gradle wrapper** (no local cache needed!)
2. ✅ **Lint checks** - Code quality validation
3. ✅ **Builds Debug and Release APKs** in parallel
4. ✅ **Uploads artifacts** for 30 days
5. ✅ **Comments on PRs** with APK download info
6. ✅ **Build summary** with all artifacts

**Caching**:
- Gradle packages cached for faster builds
- Gradle wrapper cached and shared across jobs
- ~3-5 minute build time with cache

---

### 2. **release.yml** - Automated Releases

**Triggers**:
- Push version tags (e.g., `v3.8`, `v4.0`)
- Manual dispatch from Actions tab

**What it does**:
1. ✅ **Auto-generates Gradle wrapper**
2. ✅ **Builds Debug and Release APKs**
3. ✅ **Creates GitHub Release** automatically
4. ✅ **Uploads APKs** to release
5. ✅ **Generates release notes** with:
   - APK sizes
   - Installation instructions
   - Feature list
   - Links to documentation

**Artifacts retention**: 90 days

## 🎯 How To Use

### Build APKs (Automatic)

```bash
# Just push your code - builds happen automatically!
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin main

# Check: https://github.com/mithun50/Kannada_Keyboard/actions
# Download APKs from artifacts
```

### Create a Release

```bash
# 1. Update version in app/build.gradle
# versionCode 21
# versionName "3.8"

# 2. Commit and push
git add app/build.gradle
git commit -m "Bump version to 3.8"
git push origin main

# 3. Create and push tag
git tag v3.8
git push origin v3.8

# 4. Done! Release created automatically at:
# https://github.com/mithun50/Kannada_Keyboard/releases
```

### Manual Build (Any Variant)

```bash
# Go to Actions tab
# → Click "Build APK" workflow
# → Click "Run workflow" button
# → Select variant (debug/release)
# → Click "Run workflow"
# → Download from artifacts when complete
```

## 🔧 Key Features

### Auto Gradle Wrapper Generation

**No local setup needed!** The workflow automatically:
1. Detects if `gradlew` is missing
2. Downloads Gradle 4.10.3
3. Generates wrapper files
4. Caches for all jobs
5. Makes executable

**You don't need to**:
- ❌ Install Gradle locally
- ❌ Generate wrapper manually
- ❌ Commit gradle wrapper to repo
- ❌ Have any local build cache

### Smart Caching

**Gradle Package Cache**:
- Caches `~/.gradle/caches`
- Caches `~/.gradle/wrapper`
- Key: Based on gradle files hash
- Restore: Falls back to partial matches
- **Result**: 2-3x faster builds after first run

**Gradle Wrapper Cache**:
- Caches generated wrapper between jobs
- Shared across lint, debug, and release builds
- **Result**: No regeneration in each job

### Matrix Builds

Builds run in **parallel**:
```
Lint Check     ┐
               ├─ All run simultaneously
Debug Build    │
               ├─ Finish in ~3-5 minutes
Release Build  ┘
```

Without parallel: ~15 minutes
With parallel: ~5 minutes
**Speedup**: 3x faster!

## 📊 Build Process Flow

### CI Build (build.yml)

```
Push code
   ↓
Setup Job (1 min)
├─ Checkout code
├─ Setup JDK 11
├─ Generate Gradle wrapper
└─ Cache wrapper files
   ↓
Lint Job (2 min)
├─ Download wrapper
├─ Run lint checks
└─ Upload lint reports
   ↓
Build Jobs (Parallel - 3 min)
├─ Debug Build
│  ├─ Download wrapper

│  ├─ Rename APK
│  └─ Upload artifact
│
└─ Release Build
   ├─ Download wrapper
   ├─ Build APK
   ├─ Rename APK
   └─ Upload artifact
   ↓
Summary Job

└─ Generate summary report
```

**Total time**: ~6-7 minutes (first run), ~3-5 minutes (cached)

### Release Build (release.yml)

```
Push tag v3.8
   ↓
Setup Job (1 min)
├─ Generate Gradle wrapper
└─ Cache wrapper
   ↓
Release Job (5 min)
├─ Build Debug APK
├─ Build Release APK

   ↓
Release Created! 🎉
```

**Total time**: ~6-8 minutes

## 🎨 Workflow Customization

### Change Gradle Version

Edit in both workflows:

```yaml
- name: Setup Gradle
  uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2
  with:
    gradle-version: 4.10.3  # Change this
```

### Add More Build Variants

Edit `build.yml`:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    variant: [debug, release, beta]  # Add 'beta'
```

### Change Cache Retention

```yaml
- name: Upload APK
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    retention-days: 60  # Change from 30
```

### Disable PR Comments

Remove this step from `build.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Comment on PR
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
  uses: actions/github-script@v7
  # ... remove entire step
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails: "gradle: command not found"

**Solution**: Workflow auto-generates wrapper. If it still fails:
```yaml
# Check setup job completed successfully
# Verify gradle-wrapper artifact was uploaded
# Re-run the workflow
```

### Cache Not Working

**Clear cache**:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click "Caches" in left sidebar
3. Delete all caches
4. Re-run workflow

**Or add to workflow**:
```yaml
- name: Clear cache
  run: rm -rf ~/.gradle/caches
```

### APK Not Found

**Check paths**:
```bash
# Workflow expects:
# app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
# app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk

# Verify in your project structure
```

### Workflow Not Triggering

**Enable workflows**:
1. Settings → Actions → General
2. Enable "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
3. Save

**Check branch name**:
```yaml
# Workflow triggers on:
branches:
  - main
  - master
  - develop

# Make sure your branch matches!
```
